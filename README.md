# SuperFizz Assignment = 1Module

Iterate through the numbers 0 through 1000 and for each one print out exactly one thing. These rules are in descending priority:

* If it's evenly divisible by 3, 5, and 7 print `SuperFizzBuzz`
* If it's evenly divisible by 3 and 7 print `SuperFizz`
* If it's evenly divisible by 5 and 7 print `SuperBuzz`
* If it's evenly divisible by 3, print `Fizz`
* If it's evenly divisible by 5, print `Buzz`
* If it's evenly divisible by 7, print `Super`
* Otherwise print just the number

First try to implement the algorithm in the *clearest* way you can.

Once you get that working, create a second version that uses *as few instructions/lines as you can*.
